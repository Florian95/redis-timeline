redis-timeline
===========

Redis backed timelines in your app.

Features
--------

* store your timeline in Redis.

Examples
--------

The simple way...

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Timeline::Track

      track :new_post

    end

By default, track fires in the `after_create` callback of your model and uses `self` as the object and `creator` as the actor.

You can specify these options explicity...

    class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Timeline::Track
      belongs_to :author, class_name: "User"
      belongs_to :post

      track :new_comment,
        on: :update,
        actor: :author,
        target: :post,
        object: [:body]
        followers: :post_participants

      delegate :participants, to: :post, prefix: true
    end

Parameters
----------

`track` accepts the following parameters...

the first param is the verb name.

The rest all fit neatly in an options hash.

* `on:` [ActiveModel callback]
  You use it to specify whether you want the timeline activity created after a create, update or destroy.
  Default: :create

* `actor:` [the method that specifies the object that took this action]
  In the above example, comment.author is this object.
  Default: :creator, so make sure this exists if you don't specify a method here

* `object:` defaults to self, which is good most of the time.
  You can override it if you need to

* `target:` [related to the `:object` method above. In the example this is the post related to the comment]
  default: nil

* `followers:` [who should see this story in their timeline. This references a method on the actor]
  Defaults to the method `followers` defined by Timeline::Actor.

* `extra_fields:` [accepts an array of method names that you would like to cache the value of in your timeline]
  Defaults to nil.

* `merge_similar:` [allow merge similar feed as one]
  For example, user upload some photos use multi uploader feature, you may need only on feed in timeline, so you need turn this on, then merged item will fix `object` as an Array type.
  Default: false

* `if:` symbol or proc/lambda lets you put conditions on when to track.

Display a timeline
------------------

To retrieve a timeline for a user...

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      include Timeline::Actor
    end

The timeline objects are just hashes that are extended by [Hashie](http://github.com/intridea/hashie) to provide method access to the keys.

    user = User.find(1)
    user.timeline # => [<Timeline::Activity verb='new_comment' ...>]

Requirements
------------

* redis
* active_support
* hashie

-------

Install redis.

Add to your Gemfile:

    gem 'redis-timeline'

Or install it by hand:

    gem install redis-timeline

Setup your redis instance. For a Rails app, something like this...

    # in config/initializers/redis.rb

    Timeline.redis = "localhost:6379/timeline"
